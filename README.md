#Redux Movie Search

## Introduction

Jordan's friend, Georgia Luthers is opening a movie theater. She wants to hire you because the menu board was so well done, and could use your expert skills in building a **React-Redux** movie search app. 

She already built some of it, but it doesn't quite seem to work. There's lots of bugs in addition to it not utilizing redux correctly!


## Setup

* Clone this repository. 
* Make sure to `npm install`!
* If you see an error in your terminal as well as a blank screen at http://localhost:8080 congrats! That's totally according to plan. 

## Outline

* The completed app should send the correct GET request to the server.
* The completed app dynamically searched the OMDBApi for whatever string is in the input box.
* The results are displayed below the search component.

## Steps

1. Okay so your first goal may be to see what Georgia left so far for you. What do you think is missing and stopping the basic view from rendering? (Hint: your basic javascript console may hold the secret)
