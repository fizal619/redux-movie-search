#Redux Movie Search

## Introduction

Jordan's friend, Georgia Luthers is opening a movie theater. She wants to hire you because the menu board was so well done, and could use your expert skills in building a **React-Redux** movie search app. 

She already built some of it, but it doesn't quite seem to work. There's lots of bugs in addition to it not utilizing redux correctly!
